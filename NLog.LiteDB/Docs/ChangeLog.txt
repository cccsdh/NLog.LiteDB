Enhancement:

* Update to ConnectionString to include support for 4 types:
	-Special
	-Path
	_File
	_Filename (legacy support)

*Special type allows for specifying {specialfoldername} in the ConnectionString and will replace it with the appropriate Environment.SpecialFolder path.
*Path type allows for specifying the full path.
*File type allows for just specifying the filename.
*Filename allows for those with configs using the legacy target format to continue to do so.

Special and Path also detects if the directory exists and will create it if it does not.

Refer to the README.md file for examples.
